# Facebook Login Tests

This repository contains automated tests for Facebook login functionality using Selenium WebDriver and Python.


## Test Scenarios

* `test_valid_login()`: Tests a successful login with valid credentials.
* `test_invalid_login()`: Tests an unsuccessful login with invalid credentials.


* **Facebook may block automated logins.** If you encounter issues, try using a different test account or solve the CAPTCHA manually.
* This code is simplified and may require adjustments depending on changes to the Facebook website.
* Make sure to keep your ChromeDriver version updated to match your Chrome browser version.
